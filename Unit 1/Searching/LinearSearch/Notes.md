* Time Complexity: O(n)

* Space Complexity: O(1)

* The Linear Search algorithm in C sequentially checks each element of the list 
until the key element is found or the entire list has been traversed. Therefore, 
it is known as a sequential search. The time complexity of the linear search 
algorithm in C is O(n), and space complexity is O(1).

## Linear Search Applications

1. For searching operations in smaller arrays (<100 items).
