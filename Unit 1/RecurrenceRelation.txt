# What is Recurrence Relation ?

.    A recurrence relation is an equation which represents a sequence
based on some rule. It helps in finding the subsequent term (next term) dependent upon 
the preceding term (previous term). If we know the previous term in a given series,
then we can easily determine the next term.


Ex. Binary search
.                 n
.              /     \
.             /       \
.           n/2        n/2
.          /    \     /   \
.        n/4   n/4   n/4   n/4

Type 1: Divide and conquer recurrence relations 
Type 2: Linear recurrence relations 
Type 3: Value substitution before solving
