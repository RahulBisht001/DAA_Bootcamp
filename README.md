* Binary Search Recurrence Relation : `T(n) = T(n/2) + 1` 
where `T(n)` is the time required for binary search in an array of size n.

*  Recurrence Relation of Tower of Hanoi : `T(n) = 2* T(n -1) + 1`

* Recurrence Relation of Quick Sort : `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n)`
because we need to sort the subArray of size `n-1` and partition the array of size `n` in
`O(n)` time.

* Recurrence Relation of Merge Sort : `T(n)=2T(n/2) + An`

* Recurrence Relation of Fibonacci series : `T(n) = T(n−1) + T(n−2)`
