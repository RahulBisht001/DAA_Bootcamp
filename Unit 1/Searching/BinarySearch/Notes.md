* Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in
 a sorted array.

* Binary search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items. If the elements are
 not sorted already, we need to sort them first.

 ## Binary Search Complexity

* Time Complexities

  Best case complexity: O(1)

  Average case complexity: O(log n)

  Worst case complexity: O(log n)

* Space Complexity: O(1).


## Binary Search Applications
1. In libraries of Java, .Net, C++ STL
2. While debugging, the binary search is used to pinpoint the 
place where the error happens.
