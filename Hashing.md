## Hashing Data Structure - Introduction to Hashing


### Hashing 
Hashing is a technique used in computer science and data structures to map data of arbitrary 
size to fixed-size values. The fixed-size value is called a hash code or hash value. Hashing 
is widely used in various applications, including data retrieval, indexing, and security.

The basic idea behind hashing is to use a hash function that takes an input and produces a hash code as output. The hash function should be deterministic, meaning that for a given input, it should always produce the same hash code. Additionally, it should be fast to compute the hash code.
